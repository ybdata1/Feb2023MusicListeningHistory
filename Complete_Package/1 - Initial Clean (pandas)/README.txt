This was the first step in my process.

We had 2 initial csv files to work with: "FebListenHistory.csv" and "Artist.csv"

You can find the pandas code for this initial run of pandas cleaning in 2 files:
	1 - "Artist Cleaning.ipnyb"
	2 - "Listen History Cleaning.ipnyb"

Once this was complete, I imported the two resulting files (suffixed with "_PD_CLEANED.csv")
into MS SQL server.

Welcome!

This github repo contains what I used to clean and visualize the data I've been collecting over a month. This data contains all
of my Spotify streams for the month of February 2023. The end goal is to visualize this data using a Power BI dashboard. To 
follow along, navigate to each folder in the following order:
	1 - Initial Clean (pandas)
	2 - Splitting tables (MS SQL Server)
	3 - Secondary Clean (pandas)
	4 - Power BI

The folders each have a README.txt explaining each step of the process.
